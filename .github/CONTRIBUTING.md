# Contributing to docker-java-sdk
You are interested in contributing to docker-java-sdk? Well well well. We are thrilled to have you here! 
But before you can start we need you to read this guide how to actually contribute to docker-java-sdk.
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- *And other stuff*

## We use GitHub for our daily bases
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). 
We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.

Don't worry. If you're new and you don't have any experiece in contributing, creating pull requests whatsoever
we're happy to help out. Join our Discord community server and ask for help! Someone will take care of you
and guide you through the process.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a very good bug report having a straight model explaining
what went wrong etc.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Provide sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happened
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. Not even kiddin'.
